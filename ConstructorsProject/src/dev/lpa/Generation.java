    /*

    When a class is instantiated, each enum value invokes a constructor.
    If a constructor is not defined, there won't be an issue because a default constructor is created.
    However, if a parameterized constructor exists, then there is a need for a no-args constructor.
    We can also overcome this situation by providing parameters alongside the values.
    Additionally, we can provide additional methods or similar using curly braces {}. (As demonstrated in GEN_Z)
